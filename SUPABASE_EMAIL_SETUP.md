# FinE Email Verification Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you configure Supabase to use custom email templates and redirect URLs for FinE.

## Steps to Configure Supabase

### 1. Configure Email Templates in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnmpbjcccezjfljyiwko
2. Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **Email Templates**
3. Select **Confirm signup** template
4. Replace the default template with the content from `supabase/email-templates/confirm-signup.html`
5. Update the subject line to: `Welcome to FinE - Verify Your Account ðŸŽ‰`

### 2. Configure Site URL and Redirect URLs

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication** â†’ **URL Configuration**
2. Set the **Site URL** to your production domain (e.g., `https://your-fine-app.com`)
3. Add the following **Redirect URLs**:
   - Production: `https://your-fine-app.com/verify-email`
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173/verify-email`

### 3. Update Your Sign-Up Implementation

When implementing user registration, use the custom sign-up function:

```typescript
import { signUpWithCustomRedirect } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';

// In your sign-up component
const handleSignUp = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  const { data, error } = await signUpWithCustomRedirect(
    email, 
    password,
    `${window.location.origin}/verify-email`
  );
  
  if (error) {
    console.error('Sign up error:', error);
    return;
  }
  
  // Show success message to user
  console.log('Check your email for verification link!');
};
```

### 4. Environment-Specific Configuration

For different environments, you can set different redirect URLs:

```typescript
const getRedirectUrl = () => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    return 'https://your-fine-app.com/verify-email';
  }
  return 'http://localhost:5173/verify-email';
};
```

## Production Deployment

2. Add your production domain to the redirect URLs
3. Test the entire flow in production environment
4. Monitor email delivery and verification success rates
