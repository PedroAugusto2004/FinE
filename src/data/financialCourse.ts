        content: `
Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade and commerce. It serves three primary functions:

**1. Medium of Exchange**
Money allows us to trade goods and services without the need for bartering. Instead of trading chickens for shoes, we use money as an intermediary.

**2. Store of Value**
Money can be saved and used later. It maintains its value over time (though inflation can affect this).

**3. Unit of Account**
Money provides a standard way to measure and compare the value of different goods and services.

**Types of Money:**
- **Commodity Money**: Gold, silver, or other valuable materials
- **Fiat Money**: Government-issued currency not backed by physical commodities
- **Digital Money**: Electronic forms of money, including cryptocurrencies

Understanding money is crucial for making informed financial decisions and building wealth over time.

A budget is a plan for how you'll spend your money. It helps you control your finances and achieve your goals.

**Steps to Create a Budget:**

**1. Calculate Your Income**
- Include all sources: salary, side gigs, investments
- Use your net income (after taxes)

**2. Track Your Expenses**
- Fixed expenses: rent, insurance, loan payments
- Variable expenses: groceries, entertainment, utilities
- Track for at least one month to get accurate data

**3. Categorize Your Spending**
- Housing (25-30% of income)
- Transportation (10-15%)
- Food (10-15%)
- Savings (20%)
- Entertainment (5-10%)
- Other expenses

**4. Use the 50/30/20 Rule**
- 50% for needs (housing, utilities, groceries)
- 30% for wants (entertainment, dining out)
- 20% for savings and debt repayment

**5. Monitor and Adjust**
- Review monthly
- Adjust categories as needed
- Stay flexible but disciplined

Remember: A budget isn't about restricting yourself‚Äîit's about giving yourself permission to spend on what matters most to you.

        description: 'The eighth wonder of the world',
        content: `
Compound interest is earning interest on both your original money and previously earned interest.

**How Compound Interest Works:**
- You invest $1,000 at 10% annual interest
- Year 1: $1,000 + $100 interest = $1,100
- Year 2: $1,100 + $110 interest = $1,210
- Year 3: $1,210 + $121 interest = $1,331

**The Power of Time:**
Starting at age 25 vs 35 with $200/month at 7% returns:
- Start at 25: $525,000 at retirement
- Start at 35: $245,000 at retirement
- 10 years = $280,000 difference!

**The Rule of 72:**
Divide 72 by your interest rate to find how long it takes to double your money.
- 7% return: 72 √∑ 7 = ~10 years to double
- 10% return: 72 √∑ 10 = ~7 years to double

**Maximizing Compound Interest:**
1. Start early (time is your biggest advantage)
2. Invest regularly and consistently
3. Don't withdraw early
4. Reinvest dividends and interest
5. Choose investments with good long-term returns

Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." Those who understand it, earn it. Those who don't, pay it.

Your credit score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness to lenders.

**Credit Score Ranges:**

- 740-799: Very Good
- 670-739: Good
- 580-669: Fair
- 300-579: Poor

**1. Payment History (35%)**
- Pay all bills on time
- Even one late payment can hurt your score

**2. Credit Utilization (30%)**
- Keep credit card balances low
- Use less than 30% of available credit
- Aim for under 10% for excellent scores

**3. Length of Credit History (15%)**
- Keep old accounts open
- Don't close your first credit card

**4. Credit Mix (10%)**
- Having different types of credit helps
- Credit cards, auto loans, mortgage

**5. New Credit (10%)**
- Don't apply for too much credit at once
- Hard inquiries can temporarily lower your score

**Improving Your Credit Score:**
- Pay bills on time, every time
- Pay down credit card debt
- Don't close old accounts
- Check your credit report for errors
- Consider becoming an authorized user
- Be patient - improvements take time

Good credit saves you money through lower interest rates on loans and credit cards!
